# G414

Centered around **research**.
Wants to try and use the [[GR33N]] to the robots' advantage and tries her best to not destroy it.

[[G414]] was created as some sort of advisor for the wellbeing of humanity but was later exiled when the humans decided to distance themselves from all sentient machines.

She has a very organic form, with what seems to be a human eye for a head and four arms. Her method of transportation is almost null, with her being fixed to a point held together by many metallic joints simulating a siren's tail.

## Speech

[[G414]] talks using [[X]] graphism.
Her voice module tries to imitate human speech by pronouncing each letter.
[[G414]]'s waveform spells out the letters she is saying ([[Stereo spelling]]).
