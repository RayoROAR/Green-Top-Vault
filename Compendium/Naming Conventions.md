# Naming Conventions

All names in the [[Robot World]] follow one of three naming conventions, depending on their creators, purpose and/or social status. Referring to an individual with a name in any other convention states how you see that individual. For example, those who say that FL0-W3R is like them and she should also be considered a robot citizen, call her FL0W3R. More so, those who consider FL0-W3R to be their saviour and pray to her, call her FLOWER, not because they consider her to be human, but because they see her as something greater, like a diety. Making up a nickname for robots or subjects that follow the same numbers is also a form of affection (example: G414 calls FL0-W3R "R0-S3").

## HUMAN
Created by other humans, organically.
Humans have names purely composed of letters. Their meaning may vary and they are almost never named relative to their future purpose in the eyes of the creators.

**Human/diety social status.**

Examples: *Paul, Andrew, Victor, Smith*

## R0807
Machine created by humans.
Robots have names composed of letters and numbers (modified leetspeak). Their meaning may vary and they are usually named something alluding to their purpose, may it be something more metaphoric like a diety's name or something as simple as a noun.

**Robot/citizen social status.**

Examples: *R4V, 5710G414, B4N*

## SU8-J3C7
Machine created by other machines.
Test subjects have names composed of letters and numbers with a dash in between. Usually, the numbers before the dash symbolise the generation and the numbers after determine the iteration or model. The meaning of their names is almost always related to their purpose, most of them being nouns related to their specialty or gimmick.

**Test subject/slave social status**

Examples: *FL0-0D, B0N-F1RE, 0-2ONE, FL0-W3R*
