# 0-2ONE
*AKA 0-21*

[[0-2ONE]] is a "contained destruction"-centered robot created by [[B45710N]] that uses ozone to suffocate the [[GR33N]] as a non-destructive alternative to fire. [[R420R]] was skeptical that [[B45710N]] could build an effective destructive prototype that could still protect the robot citizens so he decided against helping with its creation and instead followed [[0-2ONE]] around to study its results.

The ozone had some success keeping the [[GR33N]] at bay at the other side of the cog wall but when the ozone gas, blown by the wind, reached the [[Iron City]], it made all nearby iron and steel corrode and rust, making it a very vulnerable target for the [[GR33N]], to almost no one's knowledge (as the [[GR33N]] hadn't crossed to the robots' side of the cog wall yet).

[[0-2ONE]], unfortunately, was made of iron and ended up corroding itself with the ozone while clearing some [[GR33N]] on humanity's territory. This made its articulations stiff and it couldn't escape from the [[GR33N]] in time. [[R420R]], who had accompanied [[0-2ONE]] the whole time, was the only one that witnessed how easily the [[GR33N]] could eat up rusted iron and didn't save [[0-2ONE]] from the vines fearing that he would meet the same fate.


## Trivia

- Ozone **damages plants** by entering leaf openings called stomata and oxidizing (burning) plant tissue during respiration
- Ozone is among the most powerful oxidizing agents known. Ozone exposure accelerates the **oxidation of iron and steel** creating, in turn, a corrosion-protective film on their surface
