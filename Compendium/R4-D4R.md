# R4-D4R

[[R4-D4R]] is a multi-purpose bot fabricated by [[B45710N]]. He is directly connected to [[The Robot World]] so he reflects directly the state of the outside environment, which makes him able to locate where every bit of [[GR33N]] is located. Unfortunately, [[B45710N]] did not manage to turn him on and the experiment was discarded. [[R4-D4R]] was shot out the [[T1TANIUM-CL0UD]]
