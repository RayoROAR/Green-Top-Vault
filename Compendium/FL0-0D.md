# FL0-0D

[[FL0-0D]] is the first prototype created by [[G414]] and [[B45710N]] with the intention to combat the [[GR33N]]. He was sent to humanity's side of the cog to try and drown the [[GR33N]] with water but it ended up backfiring and water made the [[GR33N]] spread more agressively, infecting him in the process without him realising yet.

When [[FL0-0D]] got back to the robot's side of the cog, it was already too late for him and he realised his circuits were slowly being taken over by the [[GR33N]], getting progressively more agressive the closer they got to his water tank on his core. To avoid infecting any scientists or citizens, [[FL0-0D]] hid in a secret room inside the [[Iron City]] [[Junkyard]]. He's still there to this day, unconscious, with his stomach ripped right open from the [[GR33N]] reaching his water tank.
