# W4LL

[[W4LL]] (a.k.a. The Filter) is a robot whose sole purpose is to mimic me, the creator. It's a secret boss which will provide useful information if the player finds a way to defeat him without killing him. *He's a beefed up non-infected robot with two walls on his arms that he uses to attack and defend.*

His design features a 4-squared face, each square/wall getting lighter and expanding when [[W4LL]] makes any action related to that specific square/wall, each one more complicated to trigger than the last:
1. **Content**: Basically anything. E.g. he will light up the first wall when attacking or talking.
2. **Lore**: Information about Green Top's world and its characters.
3. **Secret**: Hidden/encrypted information in attack patterns, dialogue or other.
4. **Break**: Breaking the 4th wall and acknowledging the player's existence and their implication in the storyline.

He has a direct connection to communicate with our world and is the one embedding information on various pieces of the game to try and reach us. Once defeated without killing him, he will return to the Iron City as an NPC and answer whatever questions the player has between 1-4 business days (I'll answer them directly). The music track for his little shack displays a hidden message leading to the webpage with everyone's questions ans answers classified by wall triggered. This is my way of communicating with the community in case a puzzle takes more than 2 years or so to complete.
