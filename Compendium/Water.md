A copper water gun that can infect blocks, push objects around and interact with contraptions. It is not able to phase through walls. Due to its persisting nature and its electrical conductivity, it can be used to connect circuits.

**Secret use:** Given enough time, it can also corrode iron.

## Upgrade A: Scope
Allows for a more precise stream, being able to control its arch and distance.

## Upgrade B: Hose Head
Mode can be switched to Concentrated, Regular or Mist mode by crouching and pressing the respective arm button. Concentrated mode (like fire) also boosts the player, Mist mode (kinda like steam) leaves a lingering mist for combos.
