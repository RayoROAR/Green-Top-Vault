# B0N-F1RE

[[B0N-F1RE]] is a destruction-centered robot created by [[R420R]] and [[B45710N]] whose intention is to rid the robot world from the [[GR33N]] by burning it. [[B0N-F1RE]] wields a flamethrower and a fire shotgun which he uses to fly around and burn [[GR33N]].

[[B0N-F1RE]] proved to be rather unstable and started to burn down the Iron City when he sensed that the [[GR33N]] had leaked in somewhere ([[FL0-0D]]'s hidden body). He was scrapped and thrown into the [[Junkyard]] for his misinterpreted betrayal.

Much later, [[SC0-U7]] returned to the [[Junkyard]] to investigate the spot where [[R4-D4R]] landed and collapsed the ground below him. [[SC0-U7]] saw that B0N-F1RE was still alive even though he was separated into many parts and decided to upload his consciousness to the screen beside him and crush his circuits to avoid his body from being taken over by the [[GR33N]], while taking his fire shotgun arm to move around  more easily.
