# B45710N

Centered around **protection**.
Wants to get rid of the [[green]] in a safe manner to save the robots.

[[B45710N]] was one of the first sentient robots created by humanity with the purpose to protect them from any possible outside threats. He's not very powerful or threatening, his main goal is to act like a commander or general and decide which outcome or strategy would be the most favorable to ensure the wellbeing of humanity. He was later exiled.

He has a rather large body and an overall square shape. His method of transportation is rudimentary but effective, composed of a single leg with a motorised wheel at the bottom. Since his exile, he has been slowly deteriorating and his single wheel started to prove ineffective on its own so he now carries a staff to help him move around.

## Speech

His voice module pronounces letters in their morse code form.
