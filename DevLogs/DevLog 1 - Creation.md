## Log

Three days ago (12th of January), the [Pirate Software - Game Jam 14](https://itch.io/jam/pirate) started and its theme was announced: ***It's Spreading***. Today, development starts.

> *This theme centers around making a mechanic or narrative that consumes or expands in some way. Things like a pandemic, zombie apocalypse, idea, or bagel toppings come to mind. Be creative with it and work it into something unique and unexpected. Themes are there to get you to think outside the box!*
