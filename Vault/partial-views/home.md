## What's this?

This is the hub of everything Green Top related, from progress logs, to TODO checklists for me to keep track of everything, to fanart and showcase videos (and many more!).

If you haven't already, I strongly advise you to install Obsidian and open this repository's folder as a vault. This will turn all the boring plain text into something a bit more... pleasing to the eye.
