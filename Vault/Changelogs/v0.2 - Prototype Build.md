#### Fixes

##### v0.1.1 - Post-ludens
- UI text is not blurry anymore
- Fixed a visual glitch where pixels would be duplicated when the camera stopped right between two pixels
- Increased contrast with background walls for better readability
- Clouds now adjust their lifetime based on the screen's size

##### v0.1.2 - Joysticks and stones
- Minicursor now hides when pausing
- Fixed a bug where players would try to shoot when their mouse was 1px outside the game window and it wouldn't register the click. Now the mouse is confined to the game window but can easily escape it only while the game is paused
