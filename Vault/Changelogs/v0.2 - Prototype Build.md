#### Fixes

##### v0.1.1 - Post-ludens
- UI text is not blurry anymore
- Fixed a visual glitch where pixels would be duplicated when the camera stopped right between two pixels
- Increased contrast with background walls for better readability
- Clouds now adjust their lifetime based on the screen's size

##### v0.1.2 - Joysticks and stones
- Minicursor now hides when pausing
- Fixed a bug where players would try to shoot when their mouse was 1px outside the game window and it wouldn't register the click. Now the mouse is confined to the game window but can easily escape it only while the game is paused

##### v0.1.3 - Flower Power
- Fixed lag spike when respawning from far away
- Fixed a small memory leak (oopsie)
- Fixed arm jittering when climbing

##### v0.1.4 - Foundations
- Tweaked save file locations
- The player's inventory is now also saved
- Joystick position when in parkour mode (controller) is now relative to the player instead of the center of the screen
- Fixed some climbing cooldown related flickering bugs
- All floor slopes are now (kinda) climbable, regardless of material (still need to fix the physics' stability when going down slopes)
