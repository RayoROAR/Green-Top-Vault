## Comments

#### 3.0

Today I started working on making the cursor dynamically change depending on the arm equipped in that slot. The primary arm is the left section of the cursor and the secondary is the left. By deciding to make the cursor a dynamically changing sprite, I've not only solved the issue of having 999 png files for every crossair combination possible, but I've also fixed the "issue" with the previous cursor's scaling (which didn't scale at all because it was a UI element with a constant size of 44x44px). Now the cursor maintains an in-world size of 11x11px-ish at all times.

While working on this, some new issues arised, as expected. I changed this "cursor"'s Process so it doesn't freeze when pausing the game like every other object on screen. Oh, I've also created a parent object for all MiniCursors since I'm planning to scrap the idea of just having one sitting in the middle and I want there to be multiple of them instantiated in a line. I put them in a parent node to be able to simply hide that node when the game is paused instead of having to manually go through every MiniCursor one by one and hiding them.

I've left the coding session with the game in a kinda broken state: water burns tiles and fire spreads grass. By changing all the logic from specific stuff like "shootFire" to generic more scalable alternatives like "shootPrimary", I seem to have mixed up fire and water in some cases and ghost particles are swapped. Will try to fix this connection with arms, ghost particles and the actual particles before moving on to deprecating the current particles in favour of having the ghost particles themselves render.
