## Comments

Ignore the ominous nature of the title lol. This is just a dummy page to link every other DailyLog's "Last" to. This way I can simply re-link this page's Prev instead of having to change every DailyLog's Last EVERY DAY.

UPDATE: I ended up not using this technique here at all after I've found out that dataview queries can link to other pages. However, there's still hope for the DevLogs' last page.

While you're here, enjoy some more fanart:
