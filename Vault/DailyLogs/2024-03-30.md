## Comments

#### 21.0

Started fleshing out the world singleton logic a bit more adding the "restored electricity" behaviour and how it affects the tilemap via mapping tiles in the tileset to one another.

#### 21.1

Made slime/sap arm. Worked on the player singleton by making an arms inventory, the cycle logic and the dynamic cursor depending on the arms selected, all with its item acquiring logic. Still need to fix the point where the particles come out of since all of this is static to the water and fire tips right now.
