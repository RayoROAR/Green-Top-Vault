## Comments

Time to tackle everything that I procrastinated yesterday :D

#### 5.0

Fixed a grass spreading bug, fixed the fire/water stuff, logged some more, fixed some bugs with the mouse, added clouds to IngameScene, and added a debug tool that tells me the tile coords when I middle click on a tile.

#### 5.1

I wanted to log Nasty's commit but first I wanted to commit my changes too so that I can fit both of them in a single devlog. By checking if everything still worked ok and playing around, an old bug has been brought to my attention again and I tried to fix it. The game suffers from a HUGE lag spike when the player is trying to be moved from its death point to its respawn location. People online say it may be due to the CharacterBody2D still checking collisions along the way. Tried disabling them but since it's a deferred call, the collisions aren't exactly disabled until the frame after the lag spike (which is 13s too late). I'll try disabling the collision before the killbox is reached or delaying in some way the respawn so that the game has enough time to disable the body collider. If that doesn't work, I'll try simply killing the player and reconnecting everything with a new instance of the player (which I don't want to do because that would require tying too many cables for something as simple as respawning).

#### 5.2

Fixed the lag spike when teleporting player along a large amount of tiles. Managed to do it by disabling player collisions next frame after the collision, then teleporting the player right after, and then after 0.1s reenabling the collision again.

- [x] [⚠️:: 7] 🪲 Remove from infectable tiles the tile that has just been infected [➕:: 2024-03-06] [✅:: 06/03/2024]
- [x] [⚠️:: 7] 🪲 Fix new cursor double pixeling [➕:: 2024-03-06] [✅:: 06/03/2024]
- [x] [⚠️:: 7] ⚒️ Debug tool for checking tile position at mouse [➕:: 2024-03-06] [✅:: 06/03/2024]
- [ ] [⚠️:: 1] 🧮 The current state of TileStatusHandler pop_front()s infectableTiles until it finds a copper tile that hasn't been turned to grass. Find out if this tanks performance significantly more than just erase()ing the tile in question the moment it turns to grass so all the infectableTiles array is FOR SURE all non-grass. For now I'll keep it as it is in case I make copper change into some other non-grass state that's not infectable [➕:: 2024-03-06]
- [ ] [⚠️:: 6] ⚒️ Tool for painting tilemap tiles with the iron, copper or grassy variant [➕:: 2024-03-06]
- [ ] [⚠️:: 4] 🎨 Make bigger tiles? (3x3, 4x4) [➕:: 2024-03-06]
- [x] [⚠️:: 7] 🪲 Fix lag spike when respawning after dying far from spawnpoint [➕:: 2024-03-06] [✅:: 06/03/2024]
