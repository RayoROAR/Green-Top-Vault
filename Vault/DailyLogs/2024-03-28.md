#### New TODOs
- [x] [⚠️:: 6] 🎨 Update player spritesheet with jump and fall [➕:: 2024-03-28] [✅:: 28/03/2024]
- [x] [⚠️:: 6] ⚙️🎨 Update player in game animations with jump and fall [➕:: 2024-03-28] [✅:: 28/03/2024]
- [ ] [⚠️:: 1] 🧮 Check if trying to access the animator current state for the animation update every physics frame is actually very cost efficient or not. If it is, just use a string variable and assign it the current animation name every time the animation state updates. [➕:: 2024-03-28]
