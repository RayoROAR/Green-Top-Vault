## Comments

Yesterday I took the day off to play a bit so no DailyLog was done. Time to get back to it.

#### 6.0

I started off by fixing the DailyLog template so the "Last" always links to today's log. I asked for help on BitBrain's Godot twitter community on how to make the tilemap varitation tool for Nasty. Played around trying to make a rope, gave up. Found a bug in Level involving spreading glitching out when trying to infect a tile that's not from layer0, started trying to fix it.
