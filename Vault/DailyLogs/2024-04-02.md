## Comments

#### 24.X

Fixed some bugs with the new mechanics and the stop_climbing cooldown. Made and implemented pickup prompts. Made secret area fog logic. Made some new (now animated) hint signs. Started to workshop the 2px writing system. Made B0N-F1RE and FL0-0D, with each of their respective arm pickups. Made the white outline shader for when near items that can be picked up.
