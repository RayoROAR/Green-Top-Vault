## Comments

#### 27.0

I did a lot of stuff in preparation for the GodotCon at Barcelona but ended up not logging anything.

A bunch of stuff ended up breaking when setting up the scene transition from the City to the Junkyard (infinite loop of scenes referencing eachother). Tweaked the City level. Fixed some last moment error with the save/load system and went to the GodotCon.
