# DevLog X - The End

\[ [[DevLog 1 - Creation | First]] \] - \[ [[DevLog 7 - To the wall| Prev]] \] - \[ Next \] - \[ Last \] 


This isn't an actual DevLog, it's just a placeholder page for all of the other DevLogs to link to (by pressing Last). This way, instead of having to update the link on all of the DevLogs setting the Last to be the most recent one, I can simply link them all to this devlog and only change the Prev here.

Here's the first ever Green Top fanart as a filler:
